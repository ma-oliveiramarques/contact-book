ContactBook is a personal project created to save, organize and display all the contacts of a micro, small and medium enterprise.
The first goal of the project is to ciment knoladge of the programming languages evolved in the project. This was also my first project creating all the back-end and front-end by myself.

The back-end was built with Python and it's Django Framework, that connects directly all the contacts information in the database. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
In this project I used the MySQL Workbench as database and the free and open source Xampp as cross-platform web server solution stack package.
The front-end was built with HTML and CSS.
